    "Observations | Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dataset Composition and Structure:\n",
    "The dataset contains 15,000 rows and 16 columns, representing import and export transactions, with a sample of 2,001 records used for the analysis.\n",
    "Key Variables:\n",
    "Categorical: Country, Product, Import_Export, Shipping_Method, Payment_Terms, Supplier, etc.\n",
    "Numerical: Quantity, Value, Weight, Customs_Code.\n",
    "Observations/Findings:\n",
    "The dataset offers a wide range of transaction-level information, including specific countries, shipping methods, and payment terms, providing a detailed view of global trade operations.\n",
    "The dataset allows for segmentation by import and export transactions, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of trade from both perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Data Enrichment: Consider enriching the dataset with additional variables like exchange rates, transportation costs, and tariff details. This can further improve the quality of insights, especially when analyzing trade profitability and shipping logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import vs. Export Transactions:\n",
    "The analysis shows distinct differences between import and export transactions.\n",
    "Exports generally had higher transaction values, suggesting the country’s export items might be of higher value compared to imports.\n",
    "Observations/Findings:\n",
    "Exports tend to involve high-value goods, possibly electronics, machinery, or other manufactured products.\n",
    "Imports, while frequent, generally involve goods with a lower average value than exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Export Strengthening: Focus on boosting export capabilities, especially in high-value sectors like electronics and machinery, which appear to be driving significant export revenues.\n",
    "Import Strategy: For imports, investigate potential cost-saving strategies, such as negotiating better deals with suppliers or exploring alternative sourcing options to reduce costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Shipping Methods:\n",
    "Sea Freight is the most commonly used shipping method, followed by Air Freight. The preference for shipping method varies significantly depending on the type of goods being traded and the transaction value.\n",
    "Observations/Findings:\n",
    "Sea Freight dominates, likely due to its cost-effectiveness for large shipments of goods with lower value-to-weight ratios (e.g., raw materials, bulk products).\n",
    "Air Freight is primarily used for goods with higher value but lower volume, where the speed of delivery outweighs cost considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Optimize Sea Freight: Since sea freight is already the most used method, businesses should explore further optimizations, such as consolidating shipments to reduce costs or negotiating long-term contracts with shipping providers.\n",
    "Selective Air Freight Use: While air freight is more expensive, it should be strategically used for high-margin or time-sensitive products. Businesses should aim to optimize air freight by choosing faster customs clearance or expedited services for urgent shipments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Country-Specific Trends:\n",
    "The data highlights that a few countries, notably China and the USA, account for the largest number of transactions. These countries dominate in both imports and exports.\n",
    "Observations/Findings:\n",
    "China is the top partner for both imports and exports, reflecting its central role in global trade.\n",
    "Some countries are underrepresented in the dataset, suggesting potential untapped markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Diversify Trade Partners: While China and the USA are crucial trade partners, businesses should consider expanding into new markets to reduce dependency on a few key players. Emerging markets, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, may offer growth opportunities.\n",
    "Trade Agreements: Strengthen trade agreements with top partners (e.g., China and the USA) to maintain competitiveness, especially in areas like tariff negotiations and customs processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Payment Terms:\n",
    "The analysis explores different payment terms, with a focus on how they relate to transaction value. Common terms include Net 30 and Letters of Credit.\n",
    "Observations/Findings:\n",
    "Higher-value transactions are often associated with more secure payment terms (e.g., Letters of Credit), while lower-value transactions may use Net 30 or other flexible terms.\n",
    "Delays in payments or inconsistent payment terms can introduce financial risks to the business, especially when trading internationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Tailored Payment Terms: Encourage the use of secure payment terms (e.g., Letters of Credit) for high-value transactions to mitigate financial risks. For smaller transactions, offering more flexible payment options may help attract a broader customer base.\n",
    "Risk Mitigation: Introduce a risk-based approach to managing payment terms, ensuring that higher-risk markets or transactions are backed by stricter payment conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Transaction Value and Quantity Analysis:\n",
    "Detailed descriptive statistics were computed for transaction value, quantity, and weight.\n",
    "The analysis found significant variability in the value of transactions, with some high-value outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "Observations/Findings:\n",
    "There is a wide range of transaction values, with some exports showing extremely high values, likely reflecting luxury goods, specialized machinery, or high-tech exports.\n",
    "Quantities and weights also vary widely, but bulk shipments (higher quantities) tend to involve lower-value goods (e.g., raw materials).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Focus on High-Value Exports: Prioritize high-value goods for export, such as technology or machinery, which offer better profitability and potentially higher margins.\n",
    "Inventory Management: For bulk goods, businesses should adopt efficient inventory and warehousing strategies to handle large quantities at lower costs. Implementing just-in-time inventory for high-volume, low-value goods can reduce storage costs and improve cash flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Transaction Patterns by Product:\n",
    "Products traded across borders show distinct patterns. Some categories (e.g., electronics, machinery) dominate in exports, while other goods (e.g., raw materials) are frequently imported.\n",
    "Observations/Findings:\n",
    "Electronics and machinery are key export products, contributing significantly to the overall trade value.\n",
    "Raw materials and lower-end goods tend to dominate imports, reflecting the country's reliance on external sources for basic inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Leverage Core Competencies in Exports: Businesses should continue to invest in the production and export of high-demand goods like electronics and machinery, while exploring opportunities to innovate or add value to their offerings.\n",
    "Import Substitution: For imported goods that are core to manufacturing, explore domestic production or alternative suppliers to reduce reliance on external sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Risk and Opportunity Identification:\n",
    "The analysis identifies areas of risk, such as high-value exports being concentrated in a few product categories or over-reliance on a small number of countries for trade.\n",
    "Observations/Findings:\n",
    "The concentration of high-value transactions in specific products or countries increases the risk of disruptions (e.g., political instability, trade wars).\n",
    "Potential areas for expansion include underrepresented regions and product categories where competition may be less intense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Risk Mitigation: Develop risk management strategies to address the potential vulnerability of over-reliance on specific countries or products. Diversify both product lines and geographical markets.\n",
    "Explore Growth Opportunities: Consider expanding into new product categories or regions to capitalize on less saturated markets. Use predictive analytics to identify emerging trends in global trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Correlation Between Variables:\n",
    "The dataset allows for the exploration of potential correlations between variables like shipping methods, payment terms, transaction value, and product type.\n",
    "Observations/Findings:\n",
    "There may be significant correlations between shipping method and transaction value, as higher-value goods are more often shipped via air freight, while bulkier, lower-value goods use sea freight.\n",
    "Payment terms and transaction size also appear to be related, with more secure terms used for higher-value transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Segment Trade Operations: \n",
    "Develop strategies that align shipping methods and payment terms with transaction size. For example, offer favorable air freight rates for premium customers or encourage the use of secure payment terms for larger transactions to minimize financial risk.\n",
    "Custom Solutions:\n",
    "Implement customized shipping and payment options based on transaction characteristics. Businesses should tailor their offerings to meet the needs of high-value, low-volume customers differently from those dealing with bulk shipments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Summary and Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "This detailed analysis of the import-export dataset reveals key trends, risks, and opportunities in global trade operations. The recommendations suggest that businesses should focus on optimizing their shipping logistics, diversifying trade markets, and managing financial risks through tailored payment terms and strategies. By focusing on high-value exports and exploring new markets, companies can enhance profitability while reducing exposure to external risks. Data-driven decision-making and predictive analytics will further allow businesses to stay ahead of global trade trends and adapt to the evolving market landscape."

    "Analysis of data\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The mean, median, and mode of transaction values across all transactions calculated above provides valuable insights into the distribution of transaction values. Here’s what we can infer from the provided values:\n",
    "1. Mean (5004.90):\n",
    "The mean is the average of all transaction values. A mean of approximately 5004.90 suggests that the average transaction value is relatively high. However, the mean can be influenced by outliers or skewed data, so it’s essential to consider it alongside the median and mode.\n",
    "2. Median (4989.12):\n",
    "The median is the middle value when all transaction values are ordered. A median of 4989.12 indicates that half of the transactions are below this value and half are above. Since the median is very close to the mean, this suggests a relatively symmetrical distribution of transaction values, but it does not rule out the presence of outliers.\n",
    "3. Mode (3673.92):\n",
    "The mode is the most frequently occurring transaction value in the dataset. A mode of 3673.92 indicates that this value appears more often than any other. The mode being lower than both the mean and the median suggests that there may be a significant number of lower-value transactions, which could be influencing the average upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Inferences:\n",
    "Distribution Shape: The fact that the mean is higher than the median suggests a slight right skew in the distribution (more higher-value transactions). However, the closeness of the mean and median implies that the skew might not be extreme.\n",
    "Presence of Outliers: The relatively high mean compared to the mode suggests that there are higher transaction values (possibly outliers) that are affecting the average. This could warrant further investigation to understand these high-value transactions better.\n",
    "Transaction Value Trends: The mode indicates that a significant number of transactions are clustered around the value of 3673.92, which could be relevant for pricing strategies or market analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-> From the mean and median transaction values calculated by product category, we can draw several inferences:\n",
    "1. Clothing:\n",
    "Mean (4873.99) vs. Median (4976.50):\n",
    "The mean is slightly lower than the median, suggesting a slight leftward (negative) skew in the distribution. This may indicate that there are some lower-value transactions that are pulling the average down.\n",
    "2. Electronics:\n",
    "Mean (5221.99) vs. Median (5060.60):\n",
    "Here, the mean is higher than the median, indicating a slight rightward (positive) skew. This suggests that there are higher-value transactions in electronics that are driving the average up.\n",
    "3. Furniture:\n",
    "Mean (5111.78) vs. Median (5167.39):\n",
    "Similar to electronics, the mean is lower than the median. This suggests that there might be lower-value transactions affecting the average, leading to a slight leftward skew.\n",
    "4. Machinery:\n",
    "Mean (4896.36) vs. Median (4875.27):\n",
    "The mean is slightly higher than the median, indicating a very mild rightward skew, but it’s close enough to suggest a relatively symmetrical distribution around the center.\n",
    "5. Toys:\n",
    "Mean (4941.23) vs. Median (4909.81):\n",
    "The mean is again slightly higher than the median, suggesting a mild rightward skew similar to machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Inferences:\n",
    "Skewness Insights:\n",
    "Categories such as clothing and furniture show a slight leftward skew, indicating some low-value outliers. In contrast, electronics, machinery, and toys display a slight rightward skew, suggesting higher-value outliers may be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Tendency Comparison:\n",
    "The mean and median values provide insights into the central tendency of each category. For example, electronics has the highest mean and median, indicating that this category tends to have the highest transaction values overall, followed by furniture and toys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Distribution Considerations:\n",
    "The differences between mean and median in each category suggest that when analyzing transaction values, it might be helpful to consider both measures of central tendency to understand the impact of skewed distributions and potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> From the range, standard deviation, and variance of the weights of shipped products calculated above, we can infer the following:\n",
    "1. Range (4995.87):\n",
    "A range of 4995.87 suggests a large spread between the lightest and heaviest products. This indicates a diverse set of product weights, which could have implications for shipping costs, handling, and storage requirements.\n",
    "2. Standard Deviation (1462.02):\n",
    "A standard deviation of 1462.02 indicates a high degree of variability in the weights of the products. This suggests that weights are widely dispersed around the mean, meaning some products are significantly lighter or heavier than the average.\n",
    "3. Variance (2137514.84):\n",
    "A variance of 2137514.84 confirms the high variability in product weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Inferences:\n",
    "High Variability: The large range, along with the high standard deviation and variance, indicates that there is considerable variability in the weights of shipped products. This could mean that your product line includes both very light and very heavy items.\n",
    "Impact on Shipping: The variability in weight might affect shipping strategies, costs, and logistics. For example, heavier products may require different handling procedures or shipping methods compared to lighter ones.\n",
    "Potential for Optimization: If certain weights are significantly more common, it might be worth exploring whether shipping practices can be optimized for those weights, such as bulk shipping or specialized packaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "Overall, the metrics suggest a diverse and variable distribution of product weights, which could have significant implications for logistics, costs, and operational efficiency. The high degree of variability indicates a need for careful planning and consideration in shipping and handling practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The skewness and kurtosis values calculated above provide insights into the distribution of export transaction values. Here’s what we can infer from each:\n",
    "1. Skewness (0.0278):\n",
    "A skewness value close to 0 indicates that the distribution of the data is approximately symmetrical. Since the value is slightly positive, it suggests a very slight rightward (positive) skew, meaning there might be a few high-value transactions that are pulling the mean to the right, but this effect is minimal.\n",
    "2. Kurtosis (-1.1435):\n",
    "A kurtosis of -1.1435 suggests that the export transaction values have lighter tails and a flatter peak compared to a normal distribution. This means there are fewer extreme values (outliers) than we would find in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "The distribution of export transaction values is approximately symmetric with a slight rightward skew, and it is flatter than a normal distribution with fewer extreme values. This might imply that most transactions are clustered around a central value with less variability in the tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Coefficient of variation (CV) calculated above can provide the following inferences : \n",
    "1. High Variability:\n",
    "A CV above 30% typically indicates high variability relative to the mean. In our case, a CV of 59.67% suggests that the quantity of exported products is quite variable. This means there are significant fluctuations in the quantities being exported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "A CV of 59.67% indicates significant variability in the quantity of exported products, suggesting a need for careful monitoring and potentially adaptive management strategies to address the associated risks and uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> From the results of Levene's test calculated above, we can infer the following:\n",
    "1. Levene's Test Statistic (1.2582):\n",
    "A value of approximately 1.26 suggests some degree of variance differences, but this alone doesn't determine significance.\n",
    "2. P-Value (0.2844):\n",
    "The p-value indicates the probability of observing the data, or something more extreme, under the null hypothesis (which states that the variances across the groups are equal). A p-value of approximately 0.2844 is higher than the common significance level of 0.05.\n",
    "3. Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis:\n",
    "Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough statistical evidence to conclude that the variances of transaction values differ significantly between the product categories we tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "The analysis indicates that the variances in transaction values among the different product categories are not significantly different from each other. This suggests that we can assume homogeneity of variances when conducting further statistical analyses (like ANOVA) involving these product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> From the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test calculated above, we can infer the following:\n",
    "1. Shapiro-Wilk Test Statistic (0.9598):\n",
    "The test statistic provides a measure of how closely the sample distribution matches a normal distribution. Values close to 1 indicate normality, while values further from 1 suggest deviations from normality. A statistic of approximately 0.9598 indicates some departure from normality.\n",
    "2. P-Value (4.0432e-23):\n",
    "The p-value is extremely small, indicating a very low probability of observing the data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis (that the data is normally distributed) is true.\n",
    "3. Reject the Null Hypothesis:\n",
    "Since the p-value is much less than the common significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This means there is strong statistical evidence to conclude that the distribution of transaction values is not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "The analysis indicates that the distribution of transaction values significantly deviates from normality. This may have implications for further statistical analyses, as many parametric tests (like t-tests or ANOVA) assume normality. "

    "Recommendation: Tailor payment terms and shipping strategies based on transaction size and risk. For high-value transactions, secure payment terms (such as Letters of Credit) and expedited shipping (e.g., air freight) should be prioritized. For lower-value, bulk transactions, businesses can optimize costs by using sea freight and flexible payment options.\n",

Since the median is very close to the mean, this suggests a relatively symmetrical distribution of transaction values, but it does not rule out the presence of outliers.\n",
    "3. Mode (3673.92):\n",
    "The mode is the most frequently occurring transaction value in the dataset. A mode of 3673.92 indicates that this value appears more often than any other. The mode being lower than both the mean and the median suggests that there may be a significant number of lower-value transactions, which could be influencing the average upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Inferences:\n",
    "Distribution Shape: The fact that the mean is higher than the median suggests a slight right skew in the distribution (more higher-value transactions). However, the closeness of the mean and median implies that the skew might not be extreme.\n",
    "Presence of Outliers: The relatively high mean compared to the mode suggests that there are higher transaction values (possibly outliers) that are affecting the average. This could warrant further investigation to understand these high-value transactions better.\n",
    "Transaction Value Trends: The mode indicates that a significant number of transactions are clustered around the value of 3673.92, which could be relevant for pricing strategies or market analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-> From the mean and median transaction values calculated by product category, we can draw several inferences:\n",
    "1. Clothing:\n",
    "Mean (4873.99) vs. Median (4976.50):\n",
    "The mean is slightly lower than the median, suggesting a slight leftward (negative) skew in the distribution. This may indicate that there are some lower-value transactions that are pulling the average down.\n",
    "2. Electronics:\n",
    "Mean (5221.99) vs. Median (5060.60):\n",
    "Here, the mean is higher than the median, indicating a slight rightward (positive) skew. This suggests that there are higher-value transactions in electronics that are driving the average up.\n",
    "3. Furniture:\n",
    "Mean (5111.78) vs. Median (5167.39):\n",
    "Similar to electronics, the mean is lower than the median. This suggests that there might be lower-value transactions affecting the average, leading to a slight leftward skew.\n",
    "4. Machinery:\n",
    "Mean (4896.36) vs. Median (4875.27):\n",
    "The mean is slightly higher than the median, indicating a very mild rightward skew, but it’s close enough to suggest a relatively symmetrical distribution around the center.\n",
    "5. Toys:\n",
    "Mean (4941.23) vs. Median (4909.81):\n",
    "The mean is again slightly higher than the median, suggesting a mild rightward skew similar to machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Inferences:\n",
    "Skewness Insights:\n",
    "Categories such as clothing and furniture show a slight leftward skew, indicating some low-value outliers. In contrast, electronics, machinery, and toys display a slight rightward skew, suggesting higher-value outliers may be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Tendency Comparison:\n",
    "The mean and median values provide insights into the central tendency of each category. For example, electronics has the highest mean and median, indicating that this category tends to have the highest transaction values overall, followed by furniture and toys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Distribution Considerations:\n",
    "The differences between mean and median in each category suggest that when analyzing transaction values, it might be helpful to consider both measures of central tendency to understand the impact of skewed distributions and potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> From the range, standard deviation, and variance of the weights of shipped products calculated above, we can infer the following:\n",
    "1. Range (4995.87):\n",
    "A range of 4995.87 suggests a large spread between the lightest and heaviest products. This indicates a diverse set of product weights, which could have implications for shipping costs, handling, and storage requirements.\n",
    "2. Standard Deviation (1462.02):\n",
    "A standard deviation of 1462.02 indicates a high degree of variability in the weights of the products. This suggests that weights are widely dispersed around the mean, meaning some products are significantly lighter or heavier than the average.\n",
    "3. Variance (2137514.84):\n",
    "A variance of 2137514.84 confirms the high variability in product weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Inferences:\n",
    "High Variability: The large range, along with the high standard deviation and variance, indicates that there is considerable variability in the weights of shipped products. This could mean that your product line includes both very light and very heavy items.\n",
    "Impact on Shipping: The variability in weight might affect shipping strategies, costs, and logistics. For example, heavier products may require different handling procedures or shipping methods compared to lighter ones.\n",
    "Potential for Optimization: If certain weights are significantly more common, it might be worth exploring whether shipping practices can be optimized for those weights, such as bulk shipping or specialized packaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "Overall, the metrics suggest a diverse and variable distribution of product weights, which could have significant implications for logistics, costs, and operational efficiency. The high degree of variability indicates a need for careful planning and consideration in shipping and handling practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The skewness and kurtosis values calculated above provide insights into the distribution of export transaction values. Here’s what we can infer from each:\n",
    "1. Skewness (0.0278):\n",
    "A skewness value close to 0 indicates that the distribution of the data is approximately symmetrical. Since the value is slightly positive, it suggests a very slight rightward (positive) skew, meaning there might be a few high-value transactions that are pulling the mean to the right, but this effect is minimal.\n",
    "2. Kurtosis (-1.1435):\n",
    "A kurtosis of -1.1435 suggests that the export transaction values have lighter tails and a flatter peak compared to a normal distribution. This means there are fewer extreme values (outliers) than we would find in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "The distribution of export transaction values is approximately symmetric with a slight rightward skew, and it is flatter than a normal distribution with fewer extreme values. This might imply that most transactions are clustered around a central value with less variability in the tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Coefficient of variation (CV) calculated above can provide the following inferences : \n",
    "1. High Variability:\n",
    "A CV above 30% typically indicates high variability relative to the mean. In our case, a CV of 59.67% suggests that the quantity of exported products is quite variable. This means there are significant fluctuations in the quantities being exported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "A CV of 59.67% indicates significant variability in the quantity of exported products, suggesting a need for careful monitoring and potentially adaptive management strategies to address the associated risks and uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> From the results of Levene's test calculated above, we can infer the following:\n",
    "1. Levene's Test Statistic (1.2582):\n",
    "A value of approximately 1.26 suggests some degree of variance differences, but this alone doesn't determine significance.\n",
    "2. P-Value (0.2844):\n",
    "The p-value indicates the probability of observing the data, or something more extreme, under the null hypothesis (which states that the variances across the groups are equal). A p-value of approximately 0.2844 is higher than the common significance level of 0.05.\n",
    "3. Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis:\n",
    "Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough statistical evidence to conclude that the variances of transaction values differ significantly between the product categories we tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "The analysis indicates that the variances in transaction values among the different product categories are not significantly different from each other. This suggests that we can assume homogeneity of variances when conducting further statistical analyses (like ANOVA) involving these product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> From the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test calculated above, we can infer the following:\n",
    "1. Shapiro-Wilk Test Statistic (0.9598):\n",
    "The test statistic provides a measure of how closely the sample distribution matches a normal distribution. Values close to 1 indicate normality, while values further from 1 suggest deviations from normality. A statistic of approximately 0.9598 indicates some departure from normality.\n",
    "2. P-Value (4.0432e-23):\n",
    "The p-value is extremely small, indicating a very low probability of observing the data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis (that the data is normally distributed) is true.\n",
    "3. Reject the Null Hypothesis:\n",
    "Since the p-value is much less than the common significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This means there is strong statistical evidence to conclude that the distribution of transaction values is not normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary : \n",
    "The analysis indicates that the distribution of transaction values significantly deviates from normality. This may have implications for further statistical analyses, as many parametric tests (like t-tests or ANOVA) assume normality. "
